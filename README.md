[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-remember.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-remember) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Naereen/StrapDown.js.svg)](https://github.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/blob/master/LICENSE)

Include the useRemember hook in a component:

```js
const [the, remember] = useRemember();
```

From anywhere in your application:

```js
remember({ answer: 42 });
```

From anywhere else in your application:

```js
<div>{the.answer}</div>
// displays 42
```

This value is saved in local storage and will persist until you change or reset it.

## Installation & Usage

Install with `yarn add react-remember` or `npm install react-remember`.

Wrap your top-level app with the Remembererâ„¢:

```js
import Rememberer from "react-remember";

const App = () => {
  return <Rememberer>// standard app.js stuff in here</Rememberer>;
};
ReactDOM(<App />, root);
```

Now you can useRemember in any component. The data will be available everywhere, updatable from anywhere and will persist between refreshes.

```js
import { useRemember } from "react-remember";

const Button = () => {
  const [the, remember] = useRemember();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => remember({ count: ++the.count || 1 })}>
      click me
    </button>
  );
};

const Info = () => {
  const [the, remember] = useRemember();
  return <div>Button clicked {the.count} times</div>;
};
```

## Save to url (experimental)

The url parameter will store the state in the url as a query string rather than local storage.npm

```js
<Rememberer url>...</Rememberer>
```

## Defaults

Defaults are the values that are instantiated on first launch.

```js
<Rememberer
  defaults={{
    count: 42,
    user: {}
  }}
>
  ...
</Rememberer>
```

## Explorer

View a list of what's been remembered by adding the `show` property to the Rememberer.

```js
<Rememberer show defaults={{ number: 1 }}>
  ...
</Rememberer>
```
